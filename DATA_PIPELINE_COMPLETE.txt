================================================================================

LOADING DATA:
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv('structured_training_from_vet_verified.csv')

FILTERING:
  # By species
  dog_data = df[df['species'] == 'Dog']
  
  # By urgency
  severe_cases = df[df['urgency'] == 'severe']
  
  # By contagious status
  contagious = df[df['contagious'] == 'yes']
  
  # By disease
  distemper = df[df['disease'] == 'Canine Distemper']

ANALYSIS:
  # Symptom statistics
  df['symptom_count'] = df['symptoms'].apply(lambda x: len(x.split(', ')))
  print(df['symptom_count'].describe())
  
  # Disease distribution
  print(df['disease'].value_counts())
  
  # Species distribution
  print(df['species'].value_counts())

MODEL TRAINING:
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  X = df['symptoms']
  y = df['disease']
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Priority 1):
  1. Review 20 diseases with insufficient symptoms
  2. Add missing symptoms to disease profiles
  3. Regenerate training data for those diseases

SHORT-TERM (Priority 2):
  1. Use structured_training_from_vet_verified.csv for model training
  2. Train disease classification model
  3. Validate model performance

MEDIUM-TERM (Priority 3):
  1. Compare model predictions with vet diagnoses
  2. Assess accuracy per disease
  3. Identify weak areas

LONG-TERM (Priority 4):
  1. Refine symptom profiles based on model performance
  2. Add more samples for low-confidence diseases
  3. Expand to additional diseases
  4. Deploy trained model to PawPal application
