GENERATION METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

STAGE-BASED VARIATION STRATEGY:

Samples 0-9 (Early Stage):
  - Fewer symptoms (3-4)
  - Milder urgency (mild/moderate)
  - Represents initial presentation

Samples 10-19 (Mid Stage):
  - Moderate symptoms (4-6)
  - Baseline urgency from profile
  - Represents typical presentation

Samples 20-29 (Advanced Stage):
  - More symptoms (5-7)
  - Severe urgency
  - Represents advanced/complicated cases

SYMPTOM SELECTION STRATEGY:

1. Signature Symptoms (1-2):
   - Most distinctive symptoms for the disease
   - Always included in early samples
   - Helps model identify disease

2. Variable Symptoms:
   - Randomly selected from remaining symptoms
   - Varies across samples
   - Represents natural variation

3. Preservation:
   - All symptoms from vet-verified profiles
   - No AI-generated symptoms
   - Maintains medical accuracy

================================================================================
USAGE EXAMPLES
================================================================================

1. Load training data:
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('structured_training_from_vet_verified.csv')

2. Filter by species:
   dog_data = df[df['species'] == 'Dog']

3. Filter by urgency:
   severe_cases = df[df['urgency'] == 'severe']

4. Filter by contagious status:
   contagious = df[df['contagious'] == 'yes']

5. Get disease samples:
   distemper_samples = df[df['disease'] == 'Canine Distemper']

6. Analyze symptom patterns:
   df['symptom_count'] = df['symptoms'].apply(lambda x: len(x.split(', ')))
   print(df['symptom_count'].describe())

7. Train model:
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   X = df['symptoms']
   y = df['disease']
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

================================================================================
COMPARISON: ORIGINAL vs GENERATED DATA
================================================================================

ORIGINAL DATASET (pet_disease_dataset_final.csv):
  - Varied symptom extraction quality
  - Inconsistent formatting
  - Multiple name variations per disease
  - Sparse data for some diseases

GENERATED DATASET (structured_training_from_vet_verified.csv):
  - Consistent vet-verified symptoms
  - Standardized CSV format
  - Unified disease names
  - Complete coverage (30 samples per disease)
  - Realistic disease progression
  - Questionnaire-ready format

ADVANTAGES:
  ✓ Preserves veterinary accuracy
  ✓ Eliminates extraction errors
  ✓ Provides consistent training data
  ✓ Includes disease stage variations
  ✓ Ready for model training
  ✓ Traceable to vet sources

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE:
   - Review 20 diseases with insufficient symptoms
   - Add missing symptoms to profiles
   - Regenerate training data for those diseases

2. MODEL TRAINING:
   - Use structured_training_from_vet_verified.csv for model training
   - Split into train/test sets
   - Validate model performance

3. VALIDATION:
   - Compare model predictions with vet diagnoses
   - Assess accuracy on each disease
   - Identify weak areas

4. ITERATION:
   - Refine symptom profiles based on model performance
   - Add more samples for low-confidence diseases
   - Expand to additional diseases

5. DEPLOYMENT:
   - Integrate trained model into PawPal application
   - Test with real user data
   - Monitor performance in production
